<p style="text-align: left;">
  In continuing our quest to understand and realize the nature of the Self we will review and discuss:
</p>

  * “The Logos is inherent in the most brilliant light of Being and in relation to Self.” &#8211;_Pierre Grimes_
  * “All that is caused, abides in Self, proceeds from Self and reverts to the cause of Self.” &#8211;_Proclus’ Platonic Theology, Proposition 35, Balboa translation_
  * “Right inquiry (Sanskrit vichara) is the only efficacious method of tranquilizing the mind.” &#8211;_Jnana Yoga, p. 71._
  * “All things came to be through the Self, and apart from Self not one thing came to be.” &#8211;_Gospel of John, 1.3, Balboa translation_
  * “The yogi endowed with complete knowledge sees, through the eyes of knowledge, the entire universe in his own Self and regards everything as the Self and nothing else.” &#8211;_Self-Knowledge, Swami Nikhilananda._
