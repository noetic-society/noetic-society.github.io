## Copyright Information for material published on our Archive by Pierre Grimes and the Noetic Society

Pierre and we in the Noetic Society wanted to get the beauty and wisdom of Platonism (and all perennial philosophy) out to the world for free. For that reason, you are allowed to copy it (and great! thank you!). People should be able to view and raise themselves up.
