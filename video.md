Saturday Morning Talks 5/24/14

<div>
  <h1>
    <span style="font-size: medium;"><span dir="ltr" title="Sat Am 5 24 14">Proclus, Theology of Plato, Alcibiades, Tibetan yoga, Buddhism, ousia, </span>Thucydides</span>
  </h1>
</div>

<span dir="ltr" title="Sat Am 5 24 14">&#8220;Proclus as a spiritual map &#8211; spot how far you have gone, progression, sufficient description that might help identify what one is encountering, dynamic aspect, energy that emerges, the idea of rest and motion.&#8221; </span>

<span dir="ltr" title="Sat Am 5 24 14">&#8220;Buddhism in contrast to Proclus lacks analogy and hence metaphysics.&#8221; &#8220;Analogy as activating &#8216;seeing&#8217;. With a series of analogy you can present them hierarchically.&#8221;</span>

Jeff’s dream exploration. What is the mystery (of the dream)? Pathalogos. Problem of Ignorance.

&#8220;Not possible to not communicate a pathalogos. The parent does not know it is a pathalogos.”

“All observational statements, appear to be non-controversial, however, in the choice of the object you are going to describe empirically, you are already appointing a certain value of this over that.”

“Pathalogos is a parental ‘truth’.”

“The highest vision you have that you really believe you don’t know that you believe it.” “We are here to solve the problem of ignorance.&#8221;
