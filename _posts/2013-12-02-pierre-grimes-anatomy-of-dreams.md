Pierre Grimes demonstrates dreams, dreaming and the structure of dreams explored in philosophical midwifery (philosophical counseling).

These talks were recorded at the <a href="http://prs.org/wpcms/" target="_blank">Philosophical Research Society</a> where Pierre Grimes gave talks from 1995-1998.

These videos deal with dreams, fantasies and random thoughts as a doorway to understanding the intelligent, caring nature of the mind.
