  So, what is it that sees and hears, and experiences, could it be the self?
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  The search for the Self

  If you are intent upon discovering what it is that sees then it is best to discover if it is true that what ever is seen is other than the Self.  If, so it just might follow not to seek the self in the act of seeing since it won’t be seen.

  If you are intent upon discovering what it is that hears then it is best to discover if it is true that whatever is heard is other than the Self.  If, so it just might follow not to seek the Self in the act of hearing.

  If you are intent upon discovering that it is that experiences then it is best to discover if it is true that whatever is experienced is other than the Self.  If so then it just might follow not to seek the self in any experience.
</div>

</div>

<div>
  Now, that that is settled, what is the Self, if there cannot be an experience of the self?
</div>

<div>
  Surely, those who say “Know Thyself” were not fools so how did they come to know the Self?
