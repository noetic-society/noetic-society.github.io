### <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1480250848/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1480250848&linkCode=as2&tag=thenoesocinc-20" target="_blank">The Pocket Pierre</a>

Everybody has problems&#8211;and sadly, despite our best efforts, most of us daily struggle with them. As Pierre says, we try everything: &#8220;&#8230;psychotherapy, quests for heavenly intervention, Zen meditation, the priesthood or coaching Little League.&#8221;

The one thing we need is the one thing that The Pocket Pierre provides: a particular type of understanding that finally frees us from the blocks and problems we have struggled with all our life.

What makes this book different than the myriad of self-help books out there? It is based on a wonderful idea: that when it comes down to it, we live through our minds; even our emotions are in the mind.

We can use our minds to see, understand, and get rid of a particular kind of false belief that we picked up when we were young. No one taught us this belief, but we got it by observing family situations and drawing false ideas about ourselves. Why can&#8217;t we find these things easily?

It&#8217;s because we made the conclusions wordlessly, so we do not even have words for it, until, through Philosophical Midwifery explained in this book and in the Pocket Pierre Workbook, also available on Amazon, we remember the scenes and understand that these deeply-held beliefs are actually false.

In a world of quick fixes and a myriad of therapeutic interventions, The Pocket Pierre offers you something fresh and new. At last, here is something that really works.
