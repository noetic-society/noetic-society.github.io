  <h3>
    Sunday April 19th, 2015 &#8211; 6pm @ Besant Lodge, Los Angeles
  </h3>

  <div>
    <p>
      <span style="color: #000000;">We continue the well attended series on &#8220;California Occult&#8221; with a look at 3 profoundly influential figures in the esoteric spiritual history of California. Alan Watts, Aldous Huxley and Krishnamurti. </span>
    </p>

    <p>
      <span style="color: #000000;">Come join us in a live discourse with leading minds Stephan Hoeller and Pierre Grimes as they speak together about these three unique global authors and teachers who lived, loved and made their homes in California. Winter Lazerus will be your “Esoteric Au Pair” for the ongoing festivities. </span>
    </p>
    
    <div>
      <p>
        <span style="color: #000000;">The evening will be an engaging discourse as writer/speaker Dr. Pierre Grimes (who as a young man was recommended to work with Alan Watts by famed friend, the Mythologist Joseph Campbell) will share insights and personal recollections of Alan Watts. </span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span style="color: #000000;">Pierre came to the West Coast and worked intimately with Alan until Watts death. Watts (in his biography) called Pierre a “True Jnana Yogi” for his use of Platonic Dialectic in finding core issues within the human psyche. Stephan and Pierre will dialog on recollections of Watts and how he is still very influential today, thanks to his many recorded lectures which have become a genuine YouTube phenomenon. </span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span style="color: #000000;">Renown writer/lecturer Stephan Hoeller, (longtime Beachwood Canyon resident) and Pierre will share insights into the remarkable legacy of famed author and speaker Aldous Huxley (Brave New World and The Perennial Philosophy) who lived in Beachwood Canyon until his death. Aldous also developed a close relationship with the Vedanta Monastery in the canyon. </span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span style="color: #000000;">Pierre and Stephan will then explore the highly unusual teachings of Krishnamurti, who came to Beachwood Canyon as a young man and later settled in Ojai Valley. Krishnamurti became a global phenomenon as a teacher known for his unique perspectives and his famed ’Talks amongst the Oak Groves” of Ojai. </span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span style="color: #000000;">Pierre and Stephan will offer perspectives to all of this as seen from their own unique experiences, Pierre as the living embodiment of Platonic and Neo-Platonic mastery and Stephan as the one of the primary leading lights of the modern Gnostic movement throughout the world. </span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span style="color: #000000;">All are welcome! </span>
