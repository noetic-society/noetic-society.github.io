A companion to The Pocket Pierre, Unblocking will give you the tools to meet the challenge of the phrase, “Know Thyself.” You will be led through a series of questions that will help you uncover deeply-held beliefs about yourself, beliefs that have created your difficulties and prevented you from achieving your highest purpose in life.
