#### WEEK OF NOVEMBER 23-28, 2014 &#8211; Esalen

It is entirely possible to verify for oneself that we are part of a caring and intelligible universe. The verification is a kind of proof since it is a way of understanding that is based upon a realization that our mind constantly communicates with us and for our benefit. Communications from the mind are as profound as they are utterly appropriate to our circumstances, for while the scope of the mind is pervasive, its precision is always directed to what is personally and spiritually significant. The self is always seeking completion; hence, our choice of goals, the problems we face, the daydreams and fantasies we have, the seemingly random thoughts that occur during our meditations, and the dreams that visit us in our sleep — each is a doorway into the richest source of insights into our lives.

During this workshop, we will explore a new paradigm that offers a profound understanding of the way the mind functions and communicates with us for our benefit. As we focus on our dreams and daydreams with the simple rules of this new paradigm, we are brought to an awareness that our everyday existence can be the doorway to the profound, and what is often ignored can be the key to our inner development. Pierre Grimes has developed this new paradigm as a path of self-discovery over many years. It has its roots in the Homeric/Socratic tradition. Please bring writing materials and a small tape recorder for recording your dreams.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Watts" target="_blank">Alan Watts</a> recognized Pierre in his autobiography, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/In-My-Own-Way-Autobiography/dp/1577315847" target="_blank">In My Own Way</a>, as a “true Jnana Yogi; one who comes to an authentic realization, or satori, by an intellectual rather than an emotional or physical discipline.

Chong-An S’nim of the Korean Chogye Ch’an Sect sealed Pierre as Hui-An, his Dharma Successor and master dharma teacher.

In 1983 Chong-An S’nim and Pierre Hui-An Grimes founded the Opening Mind Academy for the union of the enlightenment traditions of Ch’an Buddhism and Platonism.

The most profound of insights into the nature of Mind begins with the truth that the mind is known through the mind.

The yoga traditions are one and sing the same song. The most beautiful chorus is to hear how the two most challenging spiritual systems have one song they sing aloud. For the Tibetan Jnana wisdom tradition is essentially the same as that of the classical Hellenic spiritual philosophical tradition.

In our workshop we will show that once understood the mind is always awake to a knowing that is truly transformative. We will introduce a new approach to a meditation that is not a meditation, rather it is a way of seeing through the mind that has no need for any special posture, nor mode of breathing, nor ritual to support it.

From Tibetan Buddhism: “Seek within thine own self-illuminated, self-originated Mind whence, first, all such concepts arise, and, secondly, where they exist, and, lastly, where they vanish.” &#8211; The Tibetan Book Of The Great Liberation

From the earliest Hellenic Philosophy: “It is the whole of God that sees, the whole that thinks, the whole that hears.”

A dialogue by Pierre Grimes, outlining the scope of the workshop, along with a translation of key parts of Plotinus by Juan and Maria Balboa, will be e-mailed to participants of the workshop. A schedule will also be provided.
